# Jargon

Short notes. Add as needed.

**MAE** — Maximum Adverse Excursion: the worst dip against you after the fill, as a % of entry (here: how far price went against the trade *before* the trail’s peak). Not “mean absolute error.”

**RMSE** — Root Mean Squared Error: typical size of prediction mistakes, in the same units as the target. If we predict MAE and RMSE is 2.7, guesses are off by about 2.7 percentage points on average (large errors count more than small ones).

**Ridge** — Linear regression with an L2 penalty: it shrinks coefficients so the fit does not chase noise when you have many features and few trades. `l2` is that penalty strength (bigger = more shrinkage).
